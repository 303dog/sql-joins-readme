# SQL Joins

## Objectives

1. Define SQL joins and understand when and why to use them.
2. Define the different types of SQL joins: inner, outer, left outer, right outer
3. Practice writing join statements. 

## Notes to whoever writes this:

Step 2 should cover one basic example of each type of join, all of which operate off of the same database tables. For example, if you are working with a pets database that has an owners and various pets tables (cats, dogs, lizards, whatever), keep all of the examples pertaining to that database and tables. 

Step 3 should be a code-along. Walk the students through writing a few join queries. 1 or 2 queries for each type of join. Introduce a different example set for this. i.e., no more pets database, switch to having them create a school database with students classes and teachers or some other example. Once again, same database for all of the different type of join queries. 

All of these examples can be executed in the command line.
